I'm currently working as a **Lead Developer** of the Digital workstream at **Gazprom Energy**, Manchester, UK. 

I'm a Pure Mathmematics and Mathematical Physics graduate - via a long process of feeling as an imposter for a few years, I am now a passionate software engineer - primarily writing in C#, .NET. I've recently started writing in Go and using Hugo.
