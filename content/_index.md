## Hi

Welcome to my website. My full name is Apostolis Daniel Apostolidis, most people know me as **Toli**.

I'm currently working as an **Infrastructure Automation Engineer** specialising in everything **DevOps** and **Observability** at [cinch](https://www.cinch.co.uk), Manchester, UK.

## Software Development

I'm a Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Physics graduate - via a long process of feeling as an imposter for a few years, I am now a passionate software engineer - primarily writing in **C#**, .NET.

### DevOps

My most recent endeavour is using **ARM templates**, **AZ CLI** and all things **Azure** and **Azure DevOps** to empower the squads to deliver software efficiently using the [four key metrics](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/four-key-metrics) that (has been proven that) enhance organisational performance.

## Tech in the Community

I have a passion for learning; and sharing what I've learned with friends and the community in general. I'm a co-host of [Behind The Buzzword](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Behind-The-Buzz-Word) meetup in Manchester, UK.

## Political Debates

I'm actively involved in a local DSC of [DIEM25](https://diem25.org/). Fostering and advocating debates about Europe.
