## A .NET Go Imposter

A couple of months ago (January 2019) I did a couple of things for the first time:

- gave my first public talk
- used [beautiful.ai](https://www.beautiful.ai/-LWajhsgv-w9AyBs1ejg/1) for the first time to create the slide deck

I'm not sure what I was proud about most: the presentation itself or the tool I used to create the presentation. Take a look for yourself:
