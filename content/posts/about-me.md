## Introduction

I'm currently working as a **Lead Developer** of the Digital workstream at **Gazprom Energy**, Manchester, UK. 

I'm a Pure Mathmematics and Mathematical Physics graduate - via a long process of feeling as an imposter for a few years, I am now a passionate software engineer - primarily writing in C#, .NET. I've recently started writing in Go and using Hugo.


### Tech in the Community

I have a passion for learning; and sharing what I've learned with friends and the community in general. I'm a co-host of [Behind The Buzzword](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Behind-The-Buzz-Word/events/261514601/) meetup in Manchester, UK 

### Political Debates

I'm actively involved in a local DSC of [DIEM25](https://diem25.org/). Fostering and advocating debates about Europe -  [European Spring](https://europeanspring.net/) and [policy proposals](https://www.program.europeanspring.net/).
