I'm currently working as a **Lead Developer** of the Digital workstream at **Gazprom Energy**, Manchester, UK.

I'm a Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Physics graduate - via a long process of feeling as an imposter for a few years, I am now a passionate software engineer - with my core language background being in C#, .NET. I've recently started writing in other languages, e.g. Typescript, Go  (mostly for Hugo).
